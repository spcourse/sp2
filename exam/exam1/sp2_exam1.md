# Practice exam Scientific Programming 2

This is a digital exam. The exam consists of 3 assignment in which you have to write a short python program.

You're only evaluated based on the _correctness_ of your solutions. Code design is not important. So, you don't have to worry about comments or the style guide.

You can test your code using checkpy. First download the tests for the exam:

    checkpy -d /spcourse/exam-tests

Run checkpy:

    checkpy sp2_exam2

# Rules

- Create one file for all your solutions called `sp2_exam2.py`. This is the file you'll hand in at the end of your exam.
- You're only allowed to use `pandas` package. You're not allowed any other external Python package.
- You're only allowed to use the websites sp1.mprog.nl/sp2.mprog.nl and the Pandas documentation from https://pandas.pydata.org/. You're not allowed to use any other website. (So also no Google!)
- You are allowed to look at your own code that you wrote during the course.
- You cannot get any help with programming during the exam.
- Submit your solutions when you're done. **Check with the teacher present if you handed in your assignment correctly before leaving the exam venue.**
