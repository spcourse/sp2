This is a digital exam. The exam consists of 3 assignments in which you have to write a short python program.

You can test your code using checkpy. First download the tests for the exam:

    checkpy -d /spcourse/exam-tests

Run checkpy:

    checkpy sp2_exam7

- You are allowed to look at your own code that you wrote during the course.
- You cannot get any help with programming during the exam.
- Submit your solutions when you're done. **Check with the teacher present if you handed in your assignment correctly before leaving the exam venue.**
