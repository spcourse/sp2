# Exam Scientific Programming 2

Date: October 26 2022

This is a digital exam. The exam consists of 3 assignment in which you have to write a short python program.

You're only evaluated based on the _correctness_ of your solutions, code design is not important. So, you don't have to worry about comments or the style guide.

You can test your code using checkpy. First download the tests for the exam:

    checkpy -d /spcourse/exam-tests

Run checkpy:

    checkpy sp2_exam5

# Rules

- Create one file for all your solutions called `sp2_exam5.py`. This is the file you'll hand in at the end of your exam.
- You're only allowed to use the websites sp1.mprog.nl/sp2.mprog.nl (and every website that is directly linked from there).
- You are allowed to look at your own code that you wrote during the course.
- You cannot get any help with programming during the exam.
- Submit your solutions when you're done. **Check with the teacher present if you handed in your assignment correctly before leaving the exam venue.**

### 1. Symmetric difference

The symmetric difference of two sets contains all elements that appear in one of the two sets, but not in both. So the symmetric difference of `{5, 9}` and `{9, 2}` is `{2, 5}`, as `2` appears only in the first set and `5` appears only in the second set. `9` is not part of the symmetric difference as it is part of both input sets.

Write a function `symmetric_difference(set1, set2)` that computes the symmetric difference between two sets.

Have a look a this example:

    ex1 = symmetric_difference({5, 9}, {9, 2})
    ex2 = symmetric_difference({1, 4, 2, 6, 12}, {4, 1, 8, 6, 3})

This should produce the output:

    {2, 5}
    {8, 2, 3, 12}

### 2. Groceries and recipes

You'd like todo groceries for two recipes. In order to know how much to buy of each ingredient, you're going to write a program that can combine the ingredient overview of two recipes. The ingredients for each recipe are stored in a dictionary. It is up to you to emerge them.

Write the function `combine_ingredient_dictionaries(dictionary1, dictionary2)`. That takes two dictionaries with ingredients. The output should be a combined dictionary. If the two recipes have an overlap of ingredients, the quantities should, of course, be added.  

Have a look a this example:

    ingredients_banana_bread = {"banana (pcs)": 3, "butter (g)": 80, "baking soda (tsp)": 0.5, "sugar (g)": 150, "egg (pcs)": 1, "flour (g)": 200}
    ingredients_brownies = {"butter (g)": 225, "sugar (g)": 450, "egg (pcs)": 5, "flour (g)": 110, "chocolate (g)": 140, "cocoa powder (g)": 55}

    shopping_list = combine_ingredient_dictionaries(ingredients_banana_bread, ingredients_brownies)
    print(shopping_list)

This should produce the output:

    {'banana (pcs)': 3, 'butter (g)': 305, 'baking soda (tsp)': 0.5, 'sugar (g)': 600, 'egg (pcs)': 6, 'flour (g)': 310, 'chocolate (g)': 140, 'cocoa powder (g)': 55}

### 3. Watchlist 1

We've got friends that recommend us movies to watch, but too little time to watch it. To keep track of the suggestions, you're going to build a system for this. You're going to implement two classes for keeping track of which movies you've seen and which movies you still need to watch. For this you need to implement two classes: `Watchlist` and `Movie`. `Watchlist` is a container with two lists: `movies_to_watch` and `movies_watched`. If you add movie recommendations to the list, it's going to be added to the `movies_to_watch` list, and once you've watched a move, it will move to the `movies_watched` list. `Movie` is class containing the relevant information of the movie. In our case: the name of the movie, the duration, and the director.

The following UML describes the relation between the classes:

![](umls\movies1.png)

`Watchlist` needs to implement the following methods:
    `__init__()`: set up the relevant instance variables.
    `add_movies(movie_list)`: add a list of movies that you still need to watch.
    `watch_movie(movie_name)`: enter the name of the movie you've watched. If it can be found in the `movies_to_watch` list, it will have to be transfered to `movies_watched`.
    `print_status()`: prints both the list of movies still to watch and movies to watch on two separate lines.

`Movie` only has one method:
    `__init__(name, duration, director)`: create a new object with the information provided by the parameters: name, duration, director.

> Tip: Don't forget the `self` parameter of each method when implementing this.

Have a look a this example:

    watchlist = Watchlist()
    watchlist.add_movies([Movie("Pulp Fiction", 154, "Quentin Tarantino"),
                          Movie("Barry Lyndon", 185, "Stanley Kubrick"),
                          Movie("Luca", 95, "Enrico Casarosa"),
                          Movie("Gone with the Wind", 238, "Victor Fleming")])
    watchlist.add_movies([Movie("Volver", 121, "Pedro AlmodÃ³var"),
                          Movie("The Shining", 115, "Stanley Kubrick")])
    watchlist.print_status()
    print()

    watchlist.watch_movie("Volver")
    watchlist.watch_movie("Luca")
    watchlist.print_status()

This should give the following result:

    Still to watch: Pulp Fiction, Barry Lyndon, Luca, Gone with the Wind, Volver, The Shining
    Already watched:

    Still to watch: Pulp Fiction, Barry Lyndon, Gone with the Wind, The Shining
    Already watched: Volver, Luca

### 4. Watchlist 2

We'd like to extend the code in two ways:

1. It could be nice to know how many hours of movies we've already watched and how many hours of watch time we still have ahead of us. For this we'd like to add the following methods: `total_duration_to_watch()` and `total_duration_watched()`.
2. Sometimes we organize thematic movie evenings in which we watch everything of one director. After such an evening, in stead of marking each movie off individually using `watch_movie`, it'd be convenient to be able mark all movies of a director at once. For this you need to implement the method: `watch_all_movies_of_director(movie_director)`.

You will get the following UML:

![](umls\movies2.png)

With the following testing code, added to what you already had:

    print(f'Total duration all movies still to watch: {watchlist.total_duration_to_watch()}')
    print(f'Total duration of all watched movies: {watchlist.total_duration_watched()}')
    print()

    watchlist.watch_all_movies_of_director("Stanley Kubrick")
    watchlist.print_status()
    print(f'Total duration all movies still to watch: {watchlist.total_duration_to_watch()}')
    print(f'Total duration of all watched movies: {watchlist.total_duration_watched()}')

You should get the following output:

    Total duration all movies still to watch: 692
    Total duration of all watched movies: 216

    Still to watch: Pulp Fiction, Gone with the Wind
    Already watched: Volver, Luca, Barry Lyndon, The Shining
    Total duration all movies still to watch: 392
    Total duration of all watched movies: 516
