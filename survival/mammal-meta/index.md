# Mammal meta data

The file `mammal.tsv` is a tab-separated file, containing the following columns (in order): continent, status, order, family, genus, species, log mass, combined mass, and references.

Description of the columns:

- **Continent**: Continent that a species resides on. If species resides on more than one continent, a continent specific body mass is reported when available. Thus, some mammals have multiple entries. The division between North and South America occurs at the isthmus of Panama.
- **Status**: Whether species is currently present in the wild (extant); extinct as of late Pleistocene (extinct), extinct within the last 300 years (historical); or an introduction (introduction); Note these do not necessarily follow CITES or IUCN categories.
- **Order**: Taxonomic order of species.
- **Family**: Taxonomic family of species
- **Genus**: Taxonomic genus of species.
- **Species**: Species epithet.
- **Log mass**: Log10 transformation of Combined Mass.
- **Combined mass**: Adult body mass averaged across males and females and geographic locations.
- **References**: Reference source for body mass information and/or status for that species; the updated electronic version of Wilson and Reeder (1993) (6 June 2002; www.nmnh.si.edu/msw) serves as the status reference for all extant species.
